1. Overview
Tic Tac Toe is a simple yet strategic game played on a 3×3 grid by two players. One player marks X, and the other marks O. The game continues until one player wins by forming a straight line of their marks or the grid is full (resulting in a draw).

2. Rules of the Game
The game board consists of nine empty spaces arranged in a 3×3 grid.
Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) in an empty cell.
A player wins if they form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row of three marks.
If all spaces are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
3. Problem Statement
The Tic Tac Toe problem in computer science involves creating an algorithm that can:

Evaluate the current board state.
Determine the optimal move for the AI or the player.
Ensure the best possible outcome, i.e., win the game or force a draw if the opponent also plays optimally.
4. Challenges in Solving the Problem
The number of possible game states is 9! (362,880) in the worst case.
The AI must consider all possible moves by both players.
It needs to distinguish between winning, blocking, and neutral moves.
5. Solution Approaches
To solve this problem optimally, algorithms like Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning are commonly used.

Minimax Algorithm: Simulates all possible moves and selects the best outcome.
Alpha-Beta Pruning: Optimizes Minimax by eliminating unnecessary calculations.
Heuristic Rules: A simpler approach using predefined strategies (e.g., prioritize the center).
6. Expected Outcome of a Solver
If both players play optimally, the game will always end in a draw.
If one player makes a mistake, the solver will take advantage and win.
The solver ensures unbeatable gameplay using mathematical strategies.
